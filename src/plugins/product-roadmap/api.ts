// This plugin's writes, through the host's data API.
//
// They used to live in `src/editor.ts` — core code carrying one plugin's endpoints,
// which is the coupling #17 removed. #117 removed the other half of it: the routes
// were already the generic ones, but this module reached them with the app's own
// fetch wrapper, so `HostApi.data` — the thing every third-party plugin has to use
// — was untested by the only plugin that existed.
//
// The host owns the transport now. What that buys beyond parity:
//
//   - the plugin id and the source id are bound by the host, so no call here can
//     name another plugin's collections or another timeline;
//   - the capability gate becomes real: without `data:own` there is no `data`
//     object, rather than a request that gets refused server-side;
//   - `DataApi.patch` exists because this module needed it. A partial row update
//     where `null` clears a key had no method on the contract, which is exactly the
//     gap that building a plugin in-house is supposed to surface.
//
// The entity ↔ row translation is `./compose.ts`, so a write and a read agree on
// what a row looks like by construction rather than by two people remembering the
// same thing.
