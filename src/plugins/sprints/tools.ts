// The domain rules this plugin contributes, as verbs an agent can call.
//
// This is the half of the plugin that fields cannot express. An agent gets
// `add_item` and `update_item` from the core; what it cannot get is the rule that
// decides which items belong to a sprint and what happens to the ones that did not
// finish. Kept in a prompt, such a rule cannot be tested, cannot be reused, and is
// wrong in a way nobody notices until a commitment is wrong.
//
// Every rule here follows from „a tool is a pure function": it returns changes rather
// than performing them, it reads `now` from its context and never the clock, and it
// does no I/O and touches no DOM (this module is imported statically by the registry
// and by the process that serves agent calls, which has no DOM).
//
// **The verbs follow the sprint entity, not the raster.** Membership is an assignment on
// the item (`metadata.sprint` carries a sprint row's id), so the three verbs are
// „assign", „move the unfinished work" and „report" rather than the date arithmetic the
// first cut had. What a sprint *is* — the rows, the window, the assignment lookup, the
// „done" test, the warnings — lives in `./sprints.ts` and is imported: two answers to
// „is this item in its sprint" is how one of them ends up fixed. The wording is what
// stays here, because the view words the same warning for a person and these notes word
// it for an agent.
//
// Six rules the boundaries are chosen for, each with the failure it prevents:
//
//   - **No verb here rewrites a date.** A disagreement between an item's dates and its
//     assignment is surfaced and left standing, because both silent fixes edit
//     something a person decided: moving the dates rewrites a plan, dropping the
//     assignment rewrites a commitment (`./docs/model.md`, „Membership, and the two
//     clocks").
//   - **`roll_over` has no default target.** Canon returns unfinished work to the
//     Product Backlog, the common products default to the next sprint, and choosing
//     silently would pick a philosophy on the caller's behalf. An absent target is a
//     refusal that names both options.
//   - **Finished work is never re-dated and never rolled over.** Its scope stays in the
//     sprint's sum, because that capacity really was consumed, and it keeps the sprint
//     it was finished in: the record of where something was done is the one thing a
//     later edit must not rewrite.
//   - **An item with no usable estimate is named, never counted as zero.** A sum that
//     silently omits three items reads as a capacity statement and is not one. The rule
//     is `estimateOf` in `./sprints.ts`, so „usable" means the same thing in the lanes,
//     in the view and here.
//   - **A write that cannot help is worse than a refusal.** An assignment an item
//     already carries is not written, an item whose id cannot address it is named
//     instead of put into a plan, and a roll-over into a sprint that is over is
//     refused. A write with no possible benefit looks like the tool worked, which is the
//     one outcome nobody checks.
//   - **No velocity figure and no „committed versus completed" pair, in any note.** Not
//     an omission: `./docs/model.md` („Velocity: computed, never displayed as a metric")
//     carries the sources. An extrapolation is stated as one, out of a sprint's own
//     capacity, and never as a date the plan then has to hold.
