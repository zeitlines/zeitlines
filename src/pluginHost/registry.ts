// The plugin registration seam.
//
// A plugin contributes extra item fields and, optionally, extra views on top of
// the generic timeline+list core. The core stays free of any plugin-specific
// import:
//
//   - `matches` / `views` / `fields` are lightweight, synchronous data checks —
//     they pull in NO view code, so the generic bundle never statically reaches a
//     plugin's renderers.
//   - `load()` is a dynamic import(); Rollup emits everything reachable from it
//     as a separate chunk (including the plugin's CSS, which it imports itself).
//     It runs only when a timeline enters one of the plugin's views, so a generic
//     build downloads none of it.
//
// The list is mutable rather than a `const` array because the endgame is
// installing plugins at runtime (#9): `register()` is the seam a loader will call.
// Until then the entries below are registered at module load.
