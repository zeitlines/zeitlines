// The plugin contract, as one import.
//
// This barrel is what a plugin author depends on: the manifest shape, the host
// API, the version helpers, and the design system a plugin's views are built
// from. It deliberately pulls in **no feature code from the app** — the manifest
// and version halves are types plus three pure functions, and the design system
// is a self-contained layer with no knowledge of timelines — so depending on the
// contract never means vendoring the viewer.
//
// The design system is part of the contract rather than something a plugin
// reaches for on its own, and that is the point: a plugin view is a first-class
// surface of the product, so a button in one has to be the button. Re-exporting
// it here is what makes „use the components" reachable without an import path
// into the app's internals — see docs/design-system.md.
//
// Packaging it as `@zeitlines/plugin-api` belongs with distribution
// (<https://github.com/zeitlines/zeitlines/issues/15>); until a plugin is built
// outside this repository (<https://github.com/zeitlines/zeitlines/issues/16>) the
// path is the package.
//
// **What is in here is decided by what a plugin actually needed.** Every entry
// below the host API arrived because `product-roadmap` was reaching past this
// barrel into the app to get it (#117), which is the only evidence that carries:
// a contract assembled from guesses is a contract with the wrong things in it.

// **This serves IN-TREE plugins, and only them.** A plugin compiled into the app
// is bundled with it and resolves this import like any other. A plugin loaded at
// runtime cannot: it is fetched as bytes and executed from a blob URL, with no
// bundler and no import map, so a bare specifier fails outright —
// „Failed to resolve module specifier". Handing components over `HostApi` would
// not help either, because a factory returning an `HTMLElement` is exactly the
// live object that contract excludes, on purpose, so the API can move behind a
// sandbox later (see ./hostApi.ts).
//
// What a runtime-loaded plugin uses instead is the CSS half: the tokens and the
// `ds-*` class names, which are already on the page and need nothing resolved.
// That makes those class names part of the versioned contract rather than an
// internal convention — see „Making it look like the app"
// (docs/plugin-authoring.md) and

 * it brings its own and gets back a lookup bound to the language the host is
 * rendering in. `formatDay`, `formatNumber` and `compare` come from here for the
 * same reason the components do: one set of conventions across a screen that
 * mixes core and plugin text.
 *
 * What must never go through `t`: a stored value. Only `label` moves; a select
 * option's `value` is an id in item metadata (src/i18n/storedValues.test.ts).
 *
 * DOM-free, like the rest of this file: a plugin's catalogue is read by the
 * server too, when it asks for the plugin's fields. The components moved to
 * ./viewApi.ts for exactly that reason.
