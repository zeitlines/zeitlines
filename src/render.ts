 * added *after* filtering and lane assignment: `pruneGroupsToItems` would drop an
 * item-less group, and `assignLanes` colours lanes by index, so prepending
 * earlier would shift every track's colour.
 *

// neighbourhood re-centres, which at a two-month zoom is a re-centre every few
// weeks — constantly, in use. The floor is what makes the margin a *duration*
// rather than a multiple of however far you happen to be zoomed in, so the
// re-centre stays rare at every zoom level. On a roadmap shorter than the
// neighbourhood this collapses to reserving for the whole timeline, which is the
// behaviour that never moves; the compactness only pays off once a roadmap is
// genuinely longer than the neighbourhood, and there an occasional re-centre is
