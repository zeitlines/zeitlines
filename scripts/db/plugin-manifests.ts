// Which plugins this instance has installed, and what each one declared.
//
// The write path enforces a plugin's declarations against its manifest, so it has
// to be able to find one — without running any plugin code, which is why the
// manifest is static data.
//
// Two sources, in this order:
//
//   1. **The install registry** (`installed_plugins`, migration 0017). Authoritative
//      once it holds anything at all.
//   2. **What the build shipped.** The fallback, and the only source on an instance
//      with no registry: a filesystem-only deploy has nowhere to record an install
//      and no loader to act on one, so „the plugins in this build" is the truthful
//      installed set there.
//
// The switch between them is deliberately „is the registry empty", not „does the
// registry know this id". Per-id fallback would make uninstalling a built-in
// plugin impossible — it would reappear the moment its row was gone. Migration
// 0017 seeds a row for every plugin already in use, so an existing deployment
// never sits in the ambiguous state where the rule matters.

 * `src/pluginHost/registry.ts`. A plugin missing here has no manifest to enforce
 * its declarations against — so its rows and its metadata keys are refused on a
 * deploy where the install registry is empty, while the interface shows the plugin
 * working.
 *
 * This used to say the client registry „is not reachable from the write path". It
 * stopped being true the day the MCP server began reading plugin fields and
 * derived values from it, and the sentence stayed — which is roughly how nobody
 * noticed that the same import was dragging the design system into a serverless
 * function until every deploy had been failing for a day. What holds the line now
 * is `scripts/ci/check-server-bundle.mjs`, not this paragraph: the registry *is*
 * reachable from the server, and what it may drag along is what is checked.
